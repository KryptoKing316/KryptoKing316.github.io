If **George Lucas** or **Stan Lee** offered you a **share in Star Wars or Marvel** before they were household names, **would you say yes?**

That’s what we’re doing with **Kingdom Warriors.** Backed by a team of artists and developers that’s worked for giants like **Sony, Disney, Star Wars, and Marvel**, we’re raising a new media empire for **God’s kingdom**.

So, how do you start with us and get an **early jump** on this epic media franchise? Through **NFTS and Web 3.0**.

**Web 3 will change the internet**, financial systems, and the world as we know it and **kingdom people** need to be at the forefront. Remember the verse, for such a time as this!

> **“Kingdom Warriors must be bold and brave in this new world. We have to pioneer a path for our kids to have a safe and inspiring place in the upcoming Metaverse and we do that through being some of the firsts to create gaming, animation, and media that doesn’t lack in excellence and fine detail."**



Listen, when I first got in the military, **I was a loner**. All I wanted to do was **survive** infantry school. However, I quickly learned the **importance of teamwork** and relying on your battle buddies. In combat, your squad is all you have to help you **win the war!**

And some of my friends say,

> _“Where we go one, **we go all.**”_

\
In other words, **united we stand**, divided we fall.

Now, I say, Warriors, will you **fight with me in this digital landscape** of Web 3 and help us make amazing kingdom arts and entertainment and take back the industry for the next generation!?

Will you help us to have light, hope, and a positive impact in our media and gaming world that’s been chronically dark?

Will you be able to look back at a book project, encouraging warrior art, impactful gaming, and a gripping story about **God-given identity** that reaches nations and say I was a part of something big?

**Will you unite with me and defend the Everlight?**

**Our stories of identity will reach people in every avenue of media.  Film and television, social media, gaming, VR, AR, mobile gaming.**

part of the gaming vision is **Web 3 video game** that teaches kingdom principles of **sacrifice, bravery, and honor.** Players across the globe from America to Africa and the Philippines and more will be able to **earn a livable wage simply by playing and learning to earn**.

\
**We have the models. It’s possible. Changing the landscape of Web 3, NFTs, and Play To Earn gaming for the better is well within our reach. But we can’t do it alone.**
