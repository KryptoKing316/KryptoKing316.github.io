	<h1>Paratrooper to Coder</h1> 
	
	<h2> I always dreamed of being a creator of awesome technology as a kid.  
		I came up with solutions to world problems almost everyday so naturally.
		Though in public school I struggled in math in school growing
	up and believed I couldnâ€™t become an engineer.  
	I believed some of my teachers and peers and thought I coudln't hack it as a Computer Programmer.  
 Let me stop right here and add don't ever believe something about yourself God didn't say about you! In coding everything
goes back to the origin. Thats the stuff thats important. Same in reality, the only thing that matter is what the Creator
sais. Psalm 139:14-16 TPT sais "I thank you, God, for making me so mysteriously complex! Everything you do is marvelously breathtaking.
It simply amazes me to think about it! How thoroughly you know me, Lord!  You even formed every bone in my body when you
created me in the secret place, carefully, skillfully shaping me from nothing to something. You saw who you created
me to be before I became me!" 

Moving on later in life I got married to a woman Felicia Jewell who loved me and encouraged me and told me who I really am in God.  
She brought me abundant life and three of the most precious daughters I could possibly hope for or imagine.  
After that I was on a mission to succeed.
	I became a Paratrooper in the Army and then went on to get a Business Degree at University of North Texas.
	I worked in Software Sales (SaaS) GPS tracking Tech company. 
	I sold software, but always saw bugs and found ways to improve our sites for the engineers.  
	I knew my goal since the beginning was to start my own technology company. 
	At 26 I began a journey and decided I will learn coding from scratch.  Supernaturally I was quickened by the spirit and started at Bethel School of
	Technology. I'm now on my way to become a Full Stack Developer and learning from the best. 
	 Bringing Kingdom Culture to Technology Companies near you very soon!
	
	Watch Me Go!
