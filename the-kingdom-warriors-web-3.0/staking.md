# 🤝 Staking

The day has finally arrived to put your warriors to work. Until now, the champions you’ve summoned have been sitting idle, waiting to be called into action. You may be wondering how to put your warriors to work. This article will walk you through the new Auto-Staking feature, including a brief explanation of what staking is, why you will want to participate, and how to go about staking your warrior NFTs.&#x20;

Where to begin? First, let’s start off with a brief introduction to staking. Staking (when it comes to tokens like Ethereum), is much like putting money in a savings account or Certificate of Deposit. It’s a passive way to generate income while you’re not using the asset that you’ve locked away. Depending on the staking platform, staking can be more flexible like a savings account where you can add and remove assets when you want as long as you maintain a minimum balance. It can also be more rigid than a Certificate of Deposit where your assets are locked for a set period of time and cannot be removed until the staking period has ended.&#x20;

Now, this is an incredibly oversimplified explanation of staking, as the primary purpose of staking is to validate transactions on blockchain networks that utilize what’s called a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. This and other more specific details are beyond the scope of this article, but if you would like to learn more, check out the following resource: Introduction to Crypto Staking&#x20;

Staking NFTs is a little different. Similar to staking crypto assets, you’re still earning passive income through staking. However, your NFTs are generally still usable in the game and ecosystem while being staked. Depending on the platform, staked NFTs may not be able to be sold until they are un-staked. The exact details are set by the project just like crypto assets.&#x20;

At this point, you may be thinking how does this apply to my Kingdom Warriors? Glad you asked! Kingdom Warriors is using what we’re calling “Auto-Staking”, meaning that you don’t have to choose what warriors you want to stake and which you don’t. All warriors are automatically generating you passive income. Great! Right? But why did we choose to implement staking in this manner and what does it mean if I want to sell my warriors? We decided to have your NFTs “auto-stake” in order to save you on gas fees for putting your warriors into the stake pool. You’ll have to pay a small fee to withdraw your accumulated tokens to your crypto wallet, but that’s the only fee you will have to pay. As far as selling or reselling your warriors, you are free to sell your warrior and the new owner will start receiving the staking rewards from the warrior once they take possession of it.&#x20;

The process for claiming your Everlight ($EVLT) tokens is simple. You’ll navigate to the staking page on the Kingdom Warriors website (https://kingdomwarriorsnft.com/staking) and connect your wallet. From there you’ll select the warriors that you want to claim tokens from and click “Bank”. This will put your tokens in an off-chain “vault” that you can withdraw from later. When you’re ready to move your tokens to your wallet, click the “Withdraw” button and click the button to sign your transaction in MetaMask (you will need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees) and your $EVLT tokens will be available in your wallet once the transaction is confirmed!

&#x20;\*\*NOTE: Do not initiate a withdrawal transaction unless absolutely necessary, as canceling a transaction will not put your Everlight tokens immediately back into the Bank and you will have to initiate a “recovery” transaction (“Send Warriors”) that will incur an additional gas fee. Also, do not click the “Withdraw” button multiple times as each click will initiate a new transaction thereby increasing your gas fees.&#x20;



If it’s your first time withdrawing $EVLT, you’ll probably need to add the $EVLT token to your MetaMask assets list. On the Assets/Tokens tab within MetaMask, go to the bottom of the window where it says “Import Tokens”. Click that link, select “Custom Token”, and enter the token contract address (provided below for easy copy/paste) into the appropriate box.&#x20;

**Contract address:** 0xb009C64bDD73AE4A2F32b16F5319A4597303F808&#x20;

Once you’ve pasted the contract address in the box, the other two fields should auto-populate and look like the following:

Now you can click the “Import” button and your $EVLT balance will be displayed on the Assets tab! You’ll notice on the staking page there’s also a Send Warriors option in addition to the Bank and Withdraw options.&#x20;

This option is available so that, in the event of a failed blockchain/MetaMask transaction, you can retry the transaction to redeem your tokens to your wallet. Again, as stated before, selecting this option will initiate a transaction that will require gas fees, so it is recommended that you do not withdraw $EVLT unless absolutely necessary.&#x20;

I know this is a lot of information to process and you may still have questions, so we’ve included some Frequently Asked Questions below. If you don’t see your question answered there, feel free to join our Discord and reach out to us there!

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the earning rate of my Warrior(s)?</strong></summary>

Gen 1 warriors (#0–299) will earn 300 $EVLT/day each, while Gen 2 warriors will earn 200 EVLT/day each.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What if I don’t check on my Warriors for a couple days?</strong></summary>

</details>

<details>

At the time of writing, no. However, we plan to make this option available down the road.
