# Ethereum Blockchain Based Tokens (ERC-271)

Kingdom Warriors NFTs are built on the Ethereum Blockchain (ERC-271). This is the traditional standard for NFT Tokens. In terms of the computer code that builds NFTs, all Kingdom Warriors have a unit256 which is an unsigned integer that has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2^256-1 (which is a lot). In the case of the first batch of Kingdom Warriors NFTs, our first official smart contract covers the minting of 8,888 NFTs. At this stage, Kingdom Warriors has sold 2,222 NFTs through private pre-sale without formally and publicly opening up sales.

The pre-sales began in March of 2022 with the minting of 300 genesis tokens for their first collection. By the end of March Kingdom Warriors surpassed 888 minted NFTs. By mid-April they had reached over 1,111 and in May, they sold 2,222 Kingdom Warriors NFTs. The floor price was at .11 at the end of May and by the end of June, the floor price had more than doubled to .25 per Kingdom Warriors NFT.

The genesis brand of Kingdom Warriors NFT has already reached thousands of NFT collectors and fans all over the world in over 50 countries and dozens of languages. Less than 6 months ago the early bronze, silver, gold, and kingdom key tokens were minted. One of the 22 Kingdom Keys was re-sold on the secondary market for 1 Ethereum.

Based on the sales price of .07 ETH per “Warrior”, and averaging the value of ETH at the time of the sale of the 2,222 NFTs, (approximately $3,000 per ETH) Kingdom Warriors made at least $246,642 in the first six months of their endeavor. This profit is still technically all pre-sales without any public offerings.

The Kingdom Warriors Phase II is fully sold out and the EverLight coin has auto staking capabilities that are now providing 2400 $EverLight token per day for each Generation 1 NFT held in a crypto wallet and $1600 EverLight token per day for each Generation 2 NFT. That means if a holder has one Generation 1 and one Generation 2 Kingdom Warrior NFT they will be able to earn and bank 4,000 $EverLight tokens a day for themselves.

Many Kingdom Warrior tokens have sold on the secondary market recently with the highest sale at .33 with an average sale of about .1678 ETH between April and June. The official Kingdom Warriors Opensea shows 2.2K items and 14.3 ETH traded. One of the “Super Rare” Generation 1 Kingdom Warriors NFTs is listed for 69 ETH.

In a response to the criticism that Ethereum is volatile and is not a safe standard for NFTs, Kingdom Warriors can proudly say that the recent crypto market downturn has been weathered very well by the brand.

Despite questionable practices involving “Ethereum Whales” (addresses that hold very large amounts of the digital currency). These Whale accounts appear to manipulate the digital asset market through cross-market coordination, shorting, and batch asset sales. This sets them up for opportunities to make tons of money whenever the larger cryptocurrency market crashes. Whales make quick profits on their short positions and acquire more ETH at significantly lower prices (just as a whale opens its mouth and swallows much smaller wish and plankton).

Kingdom Warriors maintains the position that despite market manipulation done by whales, the larger free-market crypto economy is a healthy, growing space with lots of room for creative brands like its knight-themed NFTs and hip-hop/ movie soundtrack NFTs. In fact, during the recent market downturn, individuals who invested their money into Kingdom Warriors NFTs were shielded from the larger market depression and actually increased the worth and value of their investments fourfold.

The future token-based economy that Kingdom Warriors will seed with its EverLight token will include the ability to purchase, produce and trade media content including music and movies. Services such as strategic consulting, graphic design, computer programming, administrative work, and other assorted talents within a unique Kingdom Warriors platform.
