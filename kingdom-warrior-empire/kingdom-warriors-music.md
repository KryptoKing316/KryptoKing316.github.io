The fact that Soundcloud.com allows for artists to change permissions to allow for outside downloads of their uploads is a **unique opportunity** that SoundCloud (alone) allows. But it‚Äôs also a conundrum for artists. What truly is the best way for artists to **monetize their own intellectual property**?

> **‚ÄúWhat truly is the best way for artists to monetize their own intellectual property? ‚Äú**

The existing pathway to **monetize for making creativity a liveable endeavor** for them is complex and circuitous (to say the least). An **artist who has a hit song** on Soundcloud or Spotify essentially must **leverage their popularity** on those platforms in order to form a relationship with an agency or management network that can then help them officialize deals with a music label, with a piece of television music licensing producer, a cinematic music licensing producer, a video game music licensing producer, maybe podcast music licensing producer, but there aren‚Äôt many other avenues after that.

For **artists who use YouTube**, there are better chances that the **monetization** from their videos can provide a more liveable income from month to month. Not only do artists get paid based on views, but they also get paid based on subscriber numbers in a more equitable way. This leads an artist who wants to live from month to month from their creative gifting and artistry to gravitate more seriously towards YouTube as a digital platform for their work. Once they begin to monetize on YouTube, the next obvious step is for them to expand their audience to platforms like TikTok and Snapchat for **monetization**.

The other option, starting with Soundcloud and Spotify, does not as easily translate to these stepping stones in monetization. In fact, many artists using Soundcloud and Spotify may also attempt to utilize Instagram or Twitter, but these platforms are not ideal for monetizing one‚Äôs music although they may be helpful for monetizing merchandise - **the merchandising route is a very different world** because it (usually) involves hiring business managers and requires initial investment to produce goods that can then be sold for a profit. Many times, these types of profitable merchandise numbers are not achieved for anywhere from 1-3 years.

The concern that most artists (reasonably) have about some of these avenues is that they will, inevitably, **find themselves in golden handcuffs**. What are golden career handcuffs? From Norm Wasserman‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Founder‚Äôs Dilemma‚Äù, ‚ÄúA major reason is that waiting to start a business introduces its own challenges.&#x20;

Working for many years can strengthen the handcuffs tying the potential \[business person] to his or her employer. **These include psychological handcuffs**, such as the social status of an impressive title or well-known employer, and ‚Äúgolden‚Äù handcuffs, such as a high salary or a vesting schedule that requires one to keep working in order to earn stock awards‚Ä¶‚ÄôI had to get off the heroin drip of a salary.‚Äô‚Äù All of these handcuffs reduce the likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur by **raising the opportunity costs** of leaving the employer, lowering the relative attractiveness of launching a startup, and reinforcing the inertia of **remaining an employee**‚Äù (49).

So what is the **actual viability of a talented artist being able to escape** the temptation of golden handcuffs? The temptation of human nature is to focus on the short-term benefit and the pleasure one derives from short-term focus. Our intention is not to capitalize on the existing music industry; **our intention is to build a better industry for future artists**.

**Now back to downloading.** The unique nature of NFTs makes the piracy of the past very hard to survive. Why? The blockchain contains authentic tracking for each and every piece of intellectual property, but it also contains nodes that each piece of intellectual property that must become attached to. Whether this is the Ethereum Blockchain or some other style of Blockchain, **no longer are individual songs, movies, and games** floating around as software that can be pirated on sites like Napster, Kazaa, Limewire, and BitTorrent. In fact, an important sign that Blockchain supports the reformation of piracy is that Limewire and Napster are now choosing to rebrand themselves as a ‚ÄúWeb 3‚Äù Companies.

A consortium of companies is now **focusing their attention** on taking well-known brands from the late 90‚Äôs and 2000‚Äôs and making them crypto-focused based on blockchain technology and digital assets. Hivemind capital is making the push to transform Napster and its CEO and Founder, Matt Zhang, is the former head of structured products at Citigroup. The fund is valued at approximately **1.5 billion** and has hired Sam Peurifoy - a former Goldman Sachs analyst to build a play-to-earn strategy for Napster‚Äôs future.&#x20;

The four main strategies of Hivemind are also strategies that could be adopted by other Web3 startups and then leveraged by even individual musicians in how to forge into a future music industry including staking and yield management; venture capital investment; crypto trading; and play-to-earn. **They‚Äôve partnered** with Algorand, founded by Turing Award-winner Silvio Micali, which provides easy-to-use tools to make blockchain technology and allows others to launch NFTs, payment solutions, regulated digital assets, new economic models, and DeFi offerings.

**LimeWire** just secured a deal with Universal Music Group to help artists launch their own NFT projects. This development is a major reconciliation between the LimeWire brand and the music industry. In 2011, the Founder of LimeWire, Mark Gorton, agreed to pay the four largest record label groups $105 million to settle a five-year litigation struggle. The settlement happened out of court and was spurred by US District Court Judge Kimba Wood shutting down the website through a court order. LimeWire was the last of the early 200‚Äôs commercial peer-to-peer networks (Kazaa, eDonkey, Grokster) to appease the goliath music labels by either settling, shutting down, or completely changing their business models. Originally, the industry sought damages of more than $1 billion from LimeWire, but the jury trial put that type of settlement into question.

> **Why is this history important to the future of the music industry through NFTs? Because it shows a major change in perspective and attitude by the major music labels around partnership, ownership and copyright because they can see that Web 3 will bring a transformation to the industry.**

In the early 2000‚Äôs the music industry took a strong stance against any form of piracy. Mitch Bainwol, the chairman and chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) at the time, said ‚ÄúDesigning and operating **services to profit** from the theft of the world‚Äôs greatest music comes with a stiff price.‚Äù There‚Äôs a lot to be dissected in just this single statement, but before we do let‚Äôs examine more about what the RIAA is and what it has been doing since it was founded in 1952.

The RIAA is a trade organization that represents the recording industry in and across the United States. Its members consist of **record labels and distributors** and its official motto is ‚ÄùFor the Music‚Äù and its official mission statement is ‚Äúto foster a business and legal climate that supports and promotes our members‚Äô creative and financial viability.‚Äù The RIAA claims that its members ‚Äúcreate, manufacture, and/or distribute approximately 85% of all legally sold recorded music in the United States.‚Äù

The RIAA has been heavily criticized over the years for its method of ruthlessly suing individuals for copyright infringement. The RIAA has sued more than 20,000 people in the United States suspected of distributing copyrighted works. The RIAA is, essentially, the Cerberus at the gates of Hades that will hunt down and punish anyone who tries to pull an Orpheus by sneaking into Hades, and **playing music for the king of the underworld**.

The RIAA tightly enforces the rules and regulations of the music industry which are almost exclusively written by the elite classes of the music industry that have become obsessed with self-preservation and keeping newcomers out. **This is the textbook definition of centralization**. Web3, in essence, is the exact opposite. Web3 supports decentralization and empowers artists and users to discover new forms of distribution and monetization while allowing them to maintain the **ownership of their own intellectual property**. This means no 360 deals, no selling of an artist‚Äôs entire catalog, no crop-sharing mentalities. The head of the RIAA, Mitch Glazier, finds a distinct foil in Stanford Law Professor Lawrence Lessig who runs the Stanford Center for Internet and Society in California. Lessig is a former clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia on the United States Supreme Court and represented website operator Eric Eldred in the ground-breaking case Eldred v. Ashcroft, a challenge to the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. He also helped to pioneer the ‚ÄúCreative Commons‚Äù copyright form which **promotes collaborative culture among digital artists and creatives.**

In playing more the **role of a prophet** who warns of the downfall of an empire before it happens, Lessig was recently quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWe need a more sophisticated approach \[to media copyright], with technologists and lawyers sitting next to behavioral psychologists and economists‚Ä¶we‚Äôre facing an existential **threat to our democracy** and we don‚Äôt have 20 years to wait.‚Äù

Twenty years after LimeWire had to pay a massive settlement to Universal Music Group (UMG), the new deal between them allows for content licensing on a global scale by opening up the LimeWire collectibles marketplace to all artists under the UMG umbrella. This will allow artists repped by Interscope Records, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, Capitol Records, Motown Records, Geffen, EMI, Virgin Music, and more to offer audio recordings, audiovisual content, backstage footage, and any artwork and images as NFTs on the LimeWire marketplace and sell them directly to fans and collectors. LimeWire raised its first round of multi-million dollar funding through the sale of its LMWR token with support from Deadmau5‚Äôs 720Ma5 venture, the DAO Jones owned by Steve Aoki, along with SwissBorg Ventures, Kraken Ventures, Arrington Capital, Crypto.com Capital, Hivemind (previously mentioned with Napster) and others. The deal lends the expertise of LimeWire‚Äôs network of investors and owners to help generate a type of OpenSea for Music NFTs and related music content and merchandise. Our work at Kingdom Warriors Music is to support the modern-day Orpheus who wants to sneak into Hades and play music for those trapped in the underworld. We want to support and empower organic content creation, **help build thriving decentralized distribution channels, and elevate artists out of lawsuits and into legacies.**
