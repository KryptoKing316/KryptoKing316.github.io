Anyone who stakes their token will receive a utility token **(EVLT)** for every day they stake. EVLT tokens can be redeemed and used in the Kingdom Warriors Game where there are a variety of characters including Kingdom Warriors, Kingdom Citizens, Kingdom Mercenaries, and Kingdom Monks. Each character role has different capabilities within the game. By defeating monsters each day, the player gets kingdom resources. Each Kingdom Warrior (Servant of the EverLight) belongs to one of the Four Guilds (Envoy, Originator, Bringer, Weaver). Each guild has a strength against four different types of enemies (Callous, Venomous, Demonic, & Destructive). Envoys are strong against Callous; Originators are strong against Venomous; Bringers are strong against Demonic; Weavers are strong against Destructive and there are four elements of items based on each guilt - and strengths and weaknesses on items based on their characteristics.

Four types of resources are gathered daily through expeditions and missions and fall into four sections that are color-coded - Red Resources, Green Resources, Yellow Resources, and Blue Resources.

Red Kingdom Resources are Warrior Weapons and are dropped by enemies (axes, spears, swords, shields, etc.).

Green Kingdom Resources are Kingdom Citizen Tokens which represent a variety of citizenry and the resources that contribute to the economic, social, environmental, and political progress of Ileydria. This includes trade contracts, travel scrolls, covenant bonds, land deeds, and more. These all can be won primarily by defeating enemies and taking back what they have stolen from Kingdom Citizens, but can also be purchased with the EverLight token.

Yellow Resources are Relationship Tokens developed through interaction with other Kingdom Citizens including Banquet Master, Tavern Owner, Minstrel, Chariot Driver, and more.

Lastly, the Blue Resources are Incanada points that are dropped by enemies but are also won by completing missions and helping other citizens. These Incada points function like Experience Points (EXP) and can be accumulated and traded for new levels of power, moves, infused into weapons, and can also be spent on leveling up items that can be used against enemies and in quests and missions.

Incada Points are spent differently based on the character guild. Envoys spend Incada on leveling up weapons (Axes, Spears, Swords, Shields, etc.) Originators spend Incada on leveling up items (ancient blueprint, slingshot, mini-trebuchet, and assorted traps and technologies to use in battle). Bringers spend Incada on leveling up unique skill sets and powers exclusively for Bringers including star casting, assistant calls, remote viewing, & extrasensory perception. Lastly, Weavers spend Incada on leveling up Summon Songs including Morning, Evening, Chronicle, and King songs. Each song transforms the battle atmosphere in a way that works to the benefit of the Weaver and their teammates.

Mercenaries are NPCs that are always available to sell you items for EverLight token and Monks will heal your character or the Kingdom in exchange for EverLight token.

The Kingdom of Ilyedria itself will have a health meter and your job, as a Kingdom Warrior, is to defend the kingdom on a daily basis against enemies. In order to do that, the player must have ample resources that will exploit the weaknesses of the attacking enemies and wisely use Incada Points, Warrior Weapons, and more to keep the health above 60%. When the health of the Kingdom falls below 80%, chaos begins to break out across the Kingdom which disrupts the normal day-to-day activity of the Kingdom. After falling below 50%, the chaos accelerates and Kingdom Mercenaries flee and disappear. After falling below 30%, Kingdom Monks retreat from the Kingdom. At 10% Kingdom Warriors are given an opportunity to activate Ilyedria‚Äôs Grace which restores the health of the Kingdom to 50%. In order to activate Ileydria‚Äôs Grace, at least 12 players must meet within the Royal boundaries of the Castle before the health of the Kingdom falls below 10%. Once at least 12 players have come together, each player must select ‚ÄúIleydria‚Äôs Grace‚Äù in order for the health restoration to occur. Ilyedria‚Äôs Grace never runs out, but if the health of the Kingdom of Ileydria gets to 0%, all of the Kingdom Resources (Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue), as well as Incada points, are completely taken from every player and the game is reset.
